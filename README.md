## Install and Setup coming....

## Contribute to Ottemo development
We use git-flow internally, but if you do not like git-flow you may use [this document](CONTRIBUTE.md) as an alternative.  

Below is a mini quickstart if you are new to git-flow and can't wait to jump into the code. 

### Initialize git-flow

    # fork or clone ottemo like below
    $ git clone https://github.com/ottemo/ottemo-go.git 

    # init git-flow, (git-flow must be installed for your OS locally)
    $ git checkout master
    $ git checkout develop
    $ git flow init -d

### Start a feature branch
    $ git flow feature start <FEATURE-NAME>

### Issue a pull request on github
    $ git push -u origin <FEATURE-BRANCH>
    # if you have git aliased to hub otherwise use the github web interface
    $ git pull-request -b develop

### Delete the local branch
    $ git branch -d <FEATURE-BRANCH>

### How start with Vagrantfile
Clone ottemo/foundation github repo (current bug with ottemo.ini)

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    sudo su -
    export GOPATH=/opt/go
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ottemo/foundation/
    go run main.go

### How to run ottemo/foundation docker container
Pull latest image from docker hub

    docker pull ottemo/foundation

Start the container and access locally (currently set to use sqlite in the container - development use only)

    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -t ottemo/foundation
